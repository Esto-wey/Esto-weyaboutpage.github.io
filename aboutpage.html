    <p>About this website, I had an idea of making a website when I got back into HTML, a programming launguage. As I learned more and more HTML I thought to my self I should make a website
       and rick-roll my friends, so I did that, but later after my great sucsses of rick-rolling my friends I thought maybe I shoud actually make this into a website. Which is exactly why 
       the about page exists. If anyone sees this then like idk read it, I plan to expand the webiste to an empire, recruiting people that I know of if, there will most likely not be any
       changes to the about page so yea, but you found it so props to you, here is a reward for finding this...nothing, but a quote from "Love is 5 minutes of pleasure for a lifetime of pain- Pope"
